To implement the specified API endpoints for orders, you can follow these steps and explanations:

1. **GET /api/orders** (Customer)

   - **Explanation**: This endpoint is used to retrieve all orders with order items created by the currently authenticated user.

   - **Steps**:
     1. Authenticate the user: Ensure that the user making the request is authenticated.
     2. Query the database: Retrieve all orders and associated order items created by the authenticated user.
     3. Serialize the data: Use a serializer to convert the retrieved data into a JSON response format.
     4. Return the response: Send the JSON response containing the user's orders and order items.

2. **POST /api/orders** (Customer)

   - **Explanation**: This endpoint is used to create a new order item for the current user. It fetches the current cart items from the cart endpoints, adds those items to the order items table, and then deletes all items from the cart for this user.

   - **Steps**:
     1. Authenticate the user: Ensure that the user making the request is authenticated.
     2. Fetch cart items: Send a request to the cart endpoints (e.g., GET /api/cart/menu-items) to retrieve the current cart items for the user.
     3. Create an order: Create a new order record in the orders table for the user.
     4. Create order items: For each cart item fetched in step 2, create a corresponding order item and associate it with the new order.
     5. Delete cart items: After creating the order items, delete all items from the user's cart (e.g., using DELETE /api/cart/menu-items).
     6. Return the response: Send a success response to indicate that the order was created successfully.

3. **GET /api/orders/{orderId}** (Customer)

   - **Explanation**: This endpoint is used to retrieve all items for a specific order ID. However, it should check whether the order ID belongs to the current user. If it doesn't, it should display an appropriate HTTP error status code.

   - **Steps**:
     1. Authenticate the user: Ensure that the user making the request is authenticated.
     2. Retrieve the order: Query the database to retrieve the order specified by {orderId}.
     3. Check ownership: Verify if the order belongs to the currently authenticated user.
     4. Serialize the data: If the user owns the order, use a serializer to convert the order items into a JSON response format.
     5. Return the response: Send the JSON response containing the order items. If the order doesn't belong to the user, return an appropriate HTTP error status code, such as 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found.

These steps and explanations outline how to implement the specified API endpoints for managing orders and order items in a Django REST framework-based application. Make sure to handle authentication, data retrieval, serialization, and error handling appropriately in your views and serializers to achieve the desired functionality.
